# Topic

Pick some subset of the information covered in your annual review article that you are interested in exploring in more detail.

The topic I want to explore in more detail is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. It's referenced multiple times throughout the article I chose and seems to have a very important role in all fields, though from what I read it's very commonly used in medicine.

Identify the scope of your user guide - what will you cover? Specific software packages? When to use or not to use a specific technique?

I would probably want to cover:

-   When and why it is used, and why it can be a better tool to use over others

-   The necessary R packages needed to perform this analysis

-   Some example code and/or simulation data

-   A way to interpret the results (example output?)
